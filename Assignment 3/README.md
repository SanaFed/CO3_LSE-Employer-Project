Research not included in the final documents: NYC Data.ipynb

- One of the hypothesis was to see if there is anything we can apply for London infrastructure (cycle parking capacity) using NYC experience.
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking/yh4a-g3fj additional information was found here.
- Small investigation was done using the original dataset we were given (Bicycle_Parking.csv). However, the conclusion was made that NYC has less developed parking capacity avalable, than London. So we decided not to investigate it further.
