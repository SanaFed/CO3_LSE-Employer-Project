CONTEXT OF THE BUSINESS PROBLEM:

Transport for London (TFL), as guided by the London Mayor’s Transport Strategy 2018 (MTS) has the central aim for 80% of all trips in London to be made on foot, by cycle or using public transport.

Cycling is expected to contribute towards TFL’s goals and benefit society in general, in many ways. From lifting and shifting road traffic and reducing network bottlenecks to improving the health of everyday commuters. Cycling as a mode of transport has tremendous potential that requires thorough analysis to allocate sufficient and effective investment and ensure its long-term adoption.

MAIN THEMES OF HYPOTHESIS ADDRESSED IN THIS REPORT The scope of our analysis focused on three main categories:

• Infrastructure: How does infrastructure affect uptake in cycling?
• Safety: How safe is cycling in London and is safety affecting uptake in cycling?
• Economic: How do socioeconomic factors contribute to cycling uptake?
